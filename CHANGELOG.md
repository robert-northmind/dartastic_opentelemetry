## [1.1.0-beta.7-wip]

### Fixed
- **`OTel.initialize()` now upgrades the API no-op factory (issue #50).** If the API auto-installed its no-op factory before SDK initialization, the SDK now replaces it with a configured SDK factory instead of refusing to initialize or later failing with API-provider-to-SDK-provider cast errors for traces, metrics, or logs.

### Added
- **`OTel.isInitialized`** reports whether `OTel.initialize()` has been called since the last `OTel.reset()`.

## [1.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-05-18
- **Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.7`.** Beta.7 fixes observable metrics and standard env var defaults.

### Fixed
- **Default metrics pipeline no longer prints to stdout.** `OTel.initialize()` used to wrap the default OTLP metric exporter in a `CompositeMetricExporter` with `ConsoleMetricExporter`, so every server using the SDK with zero env vars dumped metric payloads to the console. The default is now OTLP-only, matching traces and logs (and the OTel spec, which specifies `otlp` as the default for all three signals — never `console`). To opt back into stdout output set `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=console` (or pass an explicit `metricExporter`/`metricReader` to `OTel.initialize`).

### Added
- **`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` / `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` / `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` now honored end-to-end.** Each accepts `otlp` (default), `console`, or `none`; `none` skips processor/reader installation for that signal entirely. Previously only `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` and `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` were partially read and `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` was ignored.
- **`OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` global off-switch.** When set, `OTel.initialize()` installs no span processors, metric readers, or log record processors — the SDK becomes a no-op for all three signals. Implemented via the new `OTelEnv.isSdkDisabled()` helper.

## [1.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`package:dartastic_opentelemetry/testing.dart`** — opt-in library with the in-memory test harness used by the dart-otel-reference-demo and every OTel-Dart wrapper. Exports `InMemorySpanExporter` (with `findSpanByName` / `findSpansByName` / `findSpansStartingWith` / `clear`), `InMemoryLogExporter`, `InMemoryMetricExporter`, `OnDemandMetricReader` (timer-free; tests call `collect()` explicitly via `TestHarness.collectMetrics`), `TestHarness` aggregator, and `maybeInitializeOtelForTest()` (singleton initializer for `setUpAll`). Deliberately *not* re-exported from the main barrel so production bundles don't carry the test classes — import the `/testing.dart` path explicitly. Unifies the test scaffolding across the SDK, the reference demo, and the `otel_*` wrapper packages; previously each wrapper had its own near-identical copy.

### Removed
- **Breaking: `Tracer.startSpanWithContext` is removed.** Deprecated since 1.1.0-beta (released 2026-05-07), four betas ago. Migration is a 1:1 rename — `tracer.startSpanWithContext(name: x, context: ctx, kind: k, attributes: a)` → `tracer.startSpan(x, context: ctx, kind: k, attributes: a)`. To make the returned span active for a scope, wrap the work with `tracer.withSpan` (sync) or `tracer.withSpanAsync` (async); the deprecated method had stopped activating the span as of 1.1.0-beta anyway, so call sites that relied on activation already needed updating. Test suites that exercised `startSpanWithContext` were migrated in this release.

## [1.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- **Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.6`.** Beta.6 is a comprehensive OTel semantic-convention update — see the API CHANGELOG. Headline-level breaking changes consumers will feel:
  - The `Resource` suffix was dropped from ~60 attribute-key enums (`HttpResource.requestMethod` → `Http.requestMethod`, `UrlResource.urlFull` → `Url.urlFull`, etc.). Suffix is kept on six enums that conflict with common Dart / Flutter / library types: `ErrorResource`, `ExceptionResource`, `FileResource`, `ProcessResource`, `ServerResource` (`package:grpc`), `EventResource` (`package:web`).
  - `UserSemantics` → new `User` enum; `SessionViewSemantics` is split — OTel-spec keys (`session.id`, `session.previous_id`) → `Session`, non-spec RUM-style keys → `RumSessionView`.
  - Two new files in the API: `semantic_metrics.dart` (15 enums, ~280 metric instrument names with name + instrument kind + unit) and `semantic_events.dart` (16 spec event names). Plus a `semantic_values.dart` with typed value-set enums (`DbSystem.postgresql`, `CloudProvider.gcp`, `HttpRequestMethod.get`, etc.).
  - New `OTelAPI.attributesOf<E extends OTelSemantic>(Map<E, Object>)` helper for Dart 3.10 static dot-shorthand.
- **Breaking (web only):** `WebResourceDetector` now emits the user-agent string under `user_agent.original` (the current OTel semconv key, via `UserAgent.userAgentOriginal`) instead of `browser.user_agent`. The browser semconv namespace removed `browser.user_agent` in favor of the top-level `user_agent.*` registry — see https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/user-agent/. Backends and dashboards that filter on the old key will need to update.

## [1.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **OTLP/HTTP-JSON wire format on all three signals.** `OtlpHttpSpanExporter`, `OtlpHttpMetricExporter`, and `OtlpHttpLogRecordExporter` now accept an `OtlpHttpProtocol` config option — defaults to `httpProtobuf` (unchanged behaviour), set to `httpJson` to send proto3-JSON-encoded payloads with `Content-Type: application/json`. The encoding follows the OTLP spec's proto3-to-JSON mapping (`request.toProto3Json()` on the generated protobuf classes), so no hand-rolled JSON marshaling lives in Dartastic. Wire-up via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json` (or signal-specific `_TRACES_PROTOCOL` / `_METRICS_PROTOCOL` / `_LOGS_PROTOCOL`) flows through `OTel.initialize`. Per spec, `http/json` is `MAY`-support, not `MUST` — adding it lives up to Dartastic's "No skimping: if it's optional in the spec, it's included" promise. Unblocks integration with backends that prefer JSON (Genkit dev UI, browser-based viewers, lightweight collectors).

## [1.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Pluggable `TimeProvider` for span timestamps.** Web targets (Dart-on-JS, Wasm) automatically get `WebTimeProvider` (sub-millisecond via `window.performance.now()` + `timeOrigin`); native targets keep `SystemTimeProvider` (`DateTime.now`, unchanged behaviour). No code change required to pick up the web precision — auto-selected via the API package's platform-aware `defaultTimeProvider`. Override via `OTel.initialize(timeProvider: customProvider)` for cases like a fake clock in tests.
  The abstraction lives in `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` (see API beta.5 changelog). The SDK's `TracerProvider.timeProvider` is now a delegate getter/setter that reads through to the underlying `APITracerProvider`, so SDK and API share a single source of truth.
- `OTel.attributesFromSemanticMap(Map<OTelSemantic, Object>)` — convenience passthrough to `OTelAPI.attributesFromSemanticMap`. Lets call sites that build attribute maps from typed semconv enums skip the `.key` accessor on every entry: `OTel.attributesFromSemanticMap({HttpResource.requestMethod: 'GET'})` instead of `OTel.attributesFromMap({HttpResource.requestMethod.key: 'GET'})`. Mixing different semconv enum types in one map is fine — the param type is the `OTelSemantic` interface that every semconv enum implements.

### Changed
- README and every example under `example/` now use `attributesFromSemanticMap` for typed-enum-keyed maps. The longer `attributesFromMap` form remains for raw-string-keyed maps (`{'foo.bar': value}`) and shows up in the README only as a counter-example for app-specific keys without a typed enum.
- Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.4`. Beta.4 adds `OTelAPI.loggerProviders()` parallel to the existing `tracerProviders()` / `meterProviders()`.

### Fixed
- **Named `LoggerProvider`s now shut down with `OTel.shutdown()`.** Closes the documented gap from beta.1's fix for issue #33. Beta.1 only shut down the default `LoggerProvider`; any provider created via `OTel.addLoggerProvider(name)` still kept its `BatchLogRecordProcessor.Timer.periodic` alive, parking the Dart isolate after `main()` returned for any consumer with multiple LoggerProviders. With API beta.4's new `loggerProviders()` enumerator, `OTel.shutdown()` now iterates all of them the same way it already does for tracer / meter providers.

## [1.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-10

### Changed
- Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.3`. Beta.3 fixes a `ServiceResource` semconv key that was mangled by an over-broad find/replace: the entry called `ServiceResource.serviceResourcepace` (with key `service.Resourcepace`) is restored to `ServiceResource.serviceNamespace` / `service.namespace`. If you used the misspelled name in your own code, replace it with `ServiceResource.serviceNamespace`.

### Fixed
- **`BatchSpanProcessor.shutdown()` no longer drops queued spans.** Two pre-existing bugs in the shutdown path: (1) `shutdown()` set `_isShutdown = true` before calling `forceFlush()`, but `forceFlush()` early-returns when `_isShutdown == true` — so spans queued at the moment shutdown was invoked were silently dropped. (2) `_exportBatch()` only exported up to `maxExportBatchSize` spans and returned, so even when the drain was reached it stopped after one batch. Brought in line with `BatchLogRecordProcessor`, which has always drained correctly: `shutdown()` now drains the queue *before* setting `_isShutdown`, and both `shutdown()` and `forceFlush()` loop until the queue is empty (or the exporter throws — bailing on persistent failure rather than spinning forever).
- **Process exits cleanly after `OTel.shutdown()` (#33):** short-lived Dart CLI binaries no longer hang after `await OTel.shutdown()` returns. `OTel.shutdown()` was iterating over tracer providers and meter providers but not over the default `LoggerProvider`. The default `BatchLogRecordProcessor`'s `Timer.periodic` therefore stayed alive after `main()` returned, parking the Dart isolate in `Dart_RunLoop` indefinitely (the symptom report described `await OTel.shutdown()` "never returning", but the actual symptom is that *process exit* hangs — `print` after `await` does run). `OTel.shutdown()` now also shuts down the default `LoggerProvider`. Named LoggerProviders (created via `OTel.addLoggerProvider`) still need to be shut down by the caller — a follow-up will add a `loggerProviders()` enumerator to the API so `OTel.shutdown()` can clean them up automatically.
- **Web compatibility:** `package:dartastic_opentelemetry/dartastic_opentelemetry.dart` is now safe to import on web targets (Flutter web, `dart compile js`, `dart compile wasm`). Previously the main library transitively pulled in `dart:io` via the OTLP/HTTP exporters, certificate utilities, and the platform resource detectors — `dart compile js` accepted these imports thanks to Dart 3 stubs, but the moment any of those classes ran (`HttpClient`, `SecurityContext`, `Platform.executable`, etc.) you got `UnsupportedError` at runtime. Split into platform-conditional facades:
  - `lib/src/resource/native_detectors.dart` — exports `ProcessResourceDetector` and `HostResourceDetector` from `_io.dart` on native, from `_stub.dart` on web (stubs throw with a clear migration message if instantiated; `PlatformResourceDetector.create()` skips them on web by design).
  - `lib/src/trace/export/otlp/certificate_utils.dart` — `_io.dart` keeps `validateCertificates` + `createSecurityContext`; `_stub.dart` keeps only `validateCertificates`. The IO-only `createSecurityContext` is reachable via the IO HTTP exporter path. gRPC exporters import `certificate_utils_io.dart` directly (gRPC is IO-only by nature).
  - `lib/src/trace/export/otlp/http/http_client_factory.dart` — new helper that returns `IOClient(HttpClient(...))` on native and `BrowserClient` on web. The three OTLP HTTP exporters (`OtlpHttpSpanExporter` / `OtlpHttpMetricExporter` / `OtlpHttpLogRecordExporter`) lost their direct `dart:io` imports and now delegate `_createHttpClient()` to this factory.

  Net effect on web: tracer/metrics/logs API works, OTLP/HTTP exporters work via the browser's fetch (browser owns TLS — custom CA / mTLS settings are ignored with a warning), `PlatformResourceDetector.create()` returns the env-var + web detector composite. `OtlpGrpcSpanExporter` and friends remain native-only — gRPC over HTTP/2 trailers isn't a thing in browsers regardless of dart:io.

  New regression test: `test/web/web_compile_smoke_test.dart` runs in Chrome, imports the main library, initializes the SDK, constructs all three HTTP exporters, and runs the platform resource detector.
- **dart2wasm:** `tool/web_tests.sh` (and CI) now runs the web suite under both dart2js (default) and dart2wasm. Caught and fixed a JS-interop bug in `gzip_web.dart` — the `ReadableStream` reader yielded a `JSUint8Array` that was being cast directly to `Uint8List`, which works on dart2js but fails with `TypeError: 'JSValue' is not a subtype of type 'Uint8List'` on dart2wasm. Now goes through `JSUint8Array.toDart` so it works on both compilers.

## [1.1.0-beta] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.2` (Zone-based context propagation, contributed to the API by Kevin Moore [@kevmoo](https://github.com/kevmoo); the cross-isolate `isRemote` fix in beta.1; new `DatabaseResource.dbCollectionName`, `DatabaseResource.dbResponseReturnedRows`, and `UserSemantics.userRoles` semconv enums in beta.2; and the breaking removal of the singular `UserSemantics.userRole` in beta.2).
- **Breaking:** `Tracer.withSpan` and `Tracer.withSpanAsync` now propagate context via Zones (`Context.runSync` / `Context.run`) instead of mutating the static `Context.current`. Async callbacks within a spanned scope now correctly observe the active span across `await` boundaries; concurrent `withSpanAsync` calls no longer race on the global static.
- **Breaking:** `Tracer.startSpan` no longer auto-activates the returned span (matching the new API contract and the OpenTelemetry specification). Use `OTel.withSpan` / `OTel.withSpanAsync` (or the equivalent on `Tracer`, or the `startActiveSpan` / `startActiveSpanAsync` convenience methods) to make a span active for a scope.
- **Breaking:** removed `Tracer.recordSpan` and `Tracer.recordSpanAsync`. They were redundant with `startActiveSpan`/`Async` (which expose the span to `fn`) and the name was unclear ("record what?"). Migration: a one-liner `tracer.recordSpan(name: x, fn: f)` becomes `OTel.tracer().startActiveSpan(name: x, fn: (_) => f())`. For the explicit lifecycle, use `tracer.startSpan(...)` + `OTel.withSpan(span, fn)` + `try/catch/finally` with `span.end()` in `finally`.
- Added `OTel.withSpan(span, fn)` and `OTel.withSpanAsync(span, fn)` static convenience methods that delegate to the default tracer — saves callers from threading a `Tracer` reference for the common activation case. Both accept `APISpan` (matching the API contract for cross-implementation interop).
- **Breaking:** renamed the SDK `Logger` class to `OTelLogger` to avoid clashing with `package:logging`'s `Logger`. Migration: replace `Logger` (the SDK type) with `OTelLogger` in your code. `OTel.logger(...)` and `OTel.loggerProvider().getLogger(...)` continue to return the same instances, only the type name changed. `LoggerProvider`, `APILogger`, and other `Logger*`-prefixed symbols are unchanged.
- **Breaking:** `Tracer.startSpanWithContext` no longer mutates `Context.current`. It is now a thin wrapper around `startSpan(name, context: ctx)` and is `@Deprecated`. Activate the returned span explicitly with `Tracer.withSpan` / `withSpanAsync`.
- `Tracer.startSpan`: when both `context` and `parentSpan` are provided with different traces, the explicit `parentSpan` now wins for `traceId` and `traceFlags` resolution. Previously the SDK would build an internally inconsistent SpanContext (context's traceId + parentSpan's spanId) which the new API validation correctly rejects.
- `Tracer.startSpan`: replaced the stale `effectiveContext != Context.root` identity-style check with a content-based check (`effectiveContext.span != null` + always read `effectiveContext.spanContext`). The old check skipped parent inheritance whenever `Context.current == Context.root`, which is the case inside an isolate spawned via `Context.runIsolate()` (the API attaches the propagated context as both the isolate's current and root). Combined with the API beta.1 `isRemote` fix, trace continuity now works end-to-end across `runIsolate`.

### Added
- `OTel.contextKey<T>(name)` now accepts an optional `isTransferable` flag (default `false`) which is forwarded to the API. Custom context keys must opt in to cross-isolate transfer; built-in `Baggage` and `SpanContext` always transfer.
- Re-exported `ServerResource` and `UrlResource` semantic enums from the API.
- New regression test (`tracer_methods_test.dart`) verifying that concurrent `withSpanAsync` operations isolate their active span — would catch any future regression of the Zone migration.

### Fixed
- `test/web/util/zip/gzip_web_test.dart`: replaced a corrupt hardcoded base64 gzip blob (CRC mismatch — the browser's `DecompressionStream`, Python's `gzip`, and Node all reject it) with a freshly-generated one (`mtime=0` for a deterministic header). Pre-existing bug; the test had never passed under a strict gzip decoder.
- Tooling: `Makefile` `test-safe` and `test-web` targets pointed at `tool/run_tests.sh` and `tool/web_tests.sh`, neither of which existed. Repointed `test-safe` at the existing `tool/test.sh` (used by CI). Added `tool/web_tests.sh` running `dart test -p chrome ./test/web`.
- CI: added a `test-web` job to `.github/workflows/dart.yml` that runs `tool/web_tests.sh` in Chrome on every push and PR — web tests previously only ran locally on demand.
- Documentation: every example file (and every code snippet in the SDK and API READMEs) now uses typed enum keys for span/log/baggage attributes — never raw strings. Examples without a matching OTel-semconv enum define a small local `ExampleAttribute` / `ExampleBaggage` / `DemoAttribute` enum at the top of the file to demonstrate the recommended pattern (the placeholder name is `ExampleAttribute`/`ExampleBaggage` rather than `AppAttribute` so readers rename it for their domain instead of copying it verbatim; the redundant `app.` prefix was also dropped from invented demo keys). Replaces deprecated `net.peer.*`, `client.ip`, `http.url`, `http.response_content_length` with their modern semconv equivalents (`ServerResource.serverAddress/Port`, `ClientResource.clientAddress`, `UrlResource.urlFull`, `HttpResource.responseBodySize`).
- Examples updated for spec-aligned behavior:
  - `example.dart`, `grafana_cloud_env_example.dart`, `grafana/grafana_cloud_env_example.dart`: replaced `'url.full'` / `'url.path'` / `'net.peer.name'` / `'net.peer.port'` string literals with the new `UrlResource` and `ServerResource` enums.
  - `isolate_context_example.dart`: rewritten to use `tracer.withSpanAsync` so the parent SpanContext propagates into `runIsolate`, and to avoid capturing non-sendable SDK objects in the isolate closure. Also dropped a private `src/` import.
  - `propagator_example.dart`: built the inject Context from `span.spanContext` directly instead of relying on the deprecated auto-activation; Step 5 now reports the child span's own ids (and parent linkage) rather than the active context's.

## [1.0.2-alpha] - 2026-04-19
### Fixed
- Fixed `OTel.defaultEndpoint` to use the OTLP/HTTP port `4318` instead of the gRPC port `4317`,
  matching the default `http/protobuf` protocol per the OpenTelemetry specification (#29).
  Removed the conditional port-swap workarounds in trace and logs configuration.
- Fixed `SimpleLogRecordProcessor.shutdown()` not flushing pending exports (#28).
- Fixed flaky `OtlpGrpcLogRecordExporter endpoint empty host defaults to 127.0.0.1`
  test that depended on no process listening on port 4317.

### Changed
- `MetricsConfiguration` now defaults to the HTTP/protobuf protocol (consistent with
  the trace and logs pipelines and with the OpenTelemetry specification). Set
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc` (or
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL=grpc`) to opt back into gRPC.

### Added
- Public `exporter` getter on `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` and `exporters`
  getter on `CompositeMetricExporter` for introspection and testability.
